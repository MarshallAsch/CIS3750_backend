This is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org) RESTfull API that has a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)  database.

This is bing created by @marshallasch, @foxcroftjn, @alairon and @adriancdalessandro.


This project is being developed in partnership with @jordones, @PresumablyZach, @rrintjem, and @xXx360noScopesMLGPROxXx
who are working on the [mobile app](https://github.com/jordones/CLC-mobile).

## Installation

The installation script `./install` is a bash script that will create the database, tables as well as the user that is to be used on for the node server to access the database.

## Configuring

To run this server run `./config` where you will be prompted for the information on connection to the database.

The default port number for this application is `TCP/3000`.
